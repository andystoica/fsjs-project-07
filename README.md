Treehouse Full Stack JavaScript
Project 7 - Build a Twitter Interface
==============================================

Brief
=====

Many existing services like Twitter, Facebook, Google Maps, Paypal, and Github allow you to leverage their code in your own applications by talking to their APIs. Using Node to connect to 3rd party APIs provides much greater control than using just AJAX. Server-side communication with APIs offers many more options and greater access to data, but it also require stricter authentication methods.

In this project, you'll use Twitterâ€™s REST API to access your Twitter profile information and render it to a user. The page should automatically authenticate access to your Twitter profile. It should use this access to populate three columns on your page:

Your 5 most recent tweets.
Your 5 most recent friends.
Your 5 most recent private messages.

The ability to look at a layout and see the data behind it is an essential skill for full-stack developers. With the provided HTML and CSS starter files, you'll be able to see what the final result should look like. Replace the example data from the HTML file with your own information, which you'll grab directly from Twitter's API.


Twitter authentication
======================
You must create a config.js file using the template provided and populate the fields with your own account information.

const twitterAPIaccess = {
    consumer_key:         '...',
    consumer_secret:      '...',
    access_token:         '...',
    access_token_secret:  '...'
}

module.exports = twitterAPIaccess;
